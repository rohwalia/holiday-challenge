### Data preparation

After a first look at the offers dataset, the columns necessary for our application are:
- hotelid
- outbounddeparturedatetime
- inbounddeparturedatetime
- countadults
- countchildren
- price
- outbounddepartureairport
- mealtype
- roomtype
- oceanview

#### Prepcrossesing in params.py



A few of these are categorical data (e.g. mealtype). So reduce storage size and query times

In offers_database.py
